# AirBnB Clone

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the AirBnB platform. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the system through various commands.

## Command Interpreter Overview
The command interpreter, often referred to as "the console," provides a text-based interface for users to interact with the AirBnB system. Users can execute commands to perform various operations such as creating, listing, updating, and deleting objects like users, places, and amenities.

## How to Start
To start the command interpreter, execute the `console.py` script in the project directory.


$ ./console.py
